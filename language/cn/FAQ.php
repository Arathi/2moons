<p>In this part of the Tutorial, it is described the main buildings of the game. This explains how they should be built in the beginning and what is required to build a successful Empire.</p>
<h3>Solar plant:</h3>
<p>In order to produce accurate, precise resources that build the Solar plant, that is required for a positive manufacturing resource, so that the production does not get negative or you have the resources produced by complete</p>
<h3>Metal mine:</h3>
<p>The metal is one of the three features that will be available in the game. The metal is used for almost anything you can build or research. Therefore, a good expansion of this mine is advisable.</p>
<h3>Crystal mine and DeutÃ © rio: synthesizer</h3>
<p>The Crystal is an important resource for buildings, ships, and research. It is produced to a lesser extent than metal, which makes it more expensive.In the course of the game, you will see the how the Crystal is required. The deutÃ © is a source of energy, is the basis of fuel resources and an important research (research lab).</p>

<p>To expand your Empire and compete with other players or you need to interact with other buildings. Through the research and construction of a Hangar to begin construction of your fleet and the dwarf Planetary Defense. Details can be found here:</p>
<h3>The Hangar:</h3>
<p>Here are all the ships that you have available in this game. Some ships will required a high amount of requirements so that they can be built. An overview of the ships or defence which has technical requirements can be found under the title "technology" in the menu. The higher the Hangar, faster can be constructed.</p>
<h3>The laboratory of Research:</h3>
<p>These are used to construct new buildings, ships and defense. Also the searches can be used to get some bonus. The search can be accelerated through the expansion of the laboratory of Research</p>
<h3>Factory of Robots:</h3>
<p>The factory of robots is an essential component. Through its expansion, the time of production of probes can be reduced, as well as the construction of buildings.</p>

<p>This part of the tutorial is dedicated to defending the planet, as the first actions with your own fleet.</p>
<h3>The Heartthrob's xia:</h3>
<p>It is used to find other players. You will find s detailed information on other planets, and can also send a little of your fleet directly from this point of view. Besides, you can check at this point of view also, the contact with other players, or spy on another planet, if Espionage probes possuires</p>
<h3>Sending Fleets:</h3>
<p>Fleets can view the Heartthrob's xia, or are besides the point "fleet" sent. First, select the number of navess of a certain type of ship is scheduled to fly. It should be defined for the target (coordinates, which are obtained in vista Heartthrob ¡ xia), as well as the speed with which this should be done. Also, the type of mission as "Attack", "Colonize", "Transfer", "Destroy" or "Keep" positions is given.</p>
<h3>The Defense:</h3>
<p>To be able to protect your own planet with the construction of Hangar, is also the construction of defence. These offer some protection against the enemies with your own fleet at the moment of attack of your adervesÃ. In contrast to the fleet, 70% of existing on the planet defense continues</p>

$LNG['questions'][2][1]['title']	= 'Raid';
$LNG['questions'][2][1]['body']		= <<<BODY
<h3>Raid:</h3>
<p>It is the attack against other players for taking possession of them. There are several types of attacks such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Farmar"</li>
	<li>ACS</li>
	<li>Raid (or war)</li>
	<li>Intercept</li>
</ul>
<h3>Farmraid:</h3>
<p>These are scanned for the planets to your surroundings, and sends fleets that have sufficient transport capacity and firepower to pave the way, so for a smaller loss and a larger profit (the sum stolen resources exceed the consumption)</p>
<h3>ACS:</h3>
<p>The heyday of the Raid.<br>Here are the hunting enemy fleets servicesget specifically.<br>It is, therefore, the premier class, except as espionage and a good dose of luck and good team. If an enemy fleet saw for the first time this should only be captured and recycled. This in itself is not usually easy, once the fleets that bring profit really move many times outside their own recycling capacity. Then out of the own fleet, the recycler must have given to your destruction resources partners.</p>
<h3>Raid:</h3>
<p>It is easier to make, but also way less popular to win.
With the development of the destruction to "defeated" and how nobody can keep these in galaxa, is found and collected. The times is a great inconvenience for those who suffered the attack.</p>
<h3>IntercepÃ § Ã £ o</h3>
<p>The contents of a life of Fleeter is build fleet and destroy. Since you can not always be around fleets, you sometimes, especially to get the good players, air you more effort. This usually is not so easy, because there are ways to protect yourself.</p>

$LNG['questions'][2][2]['body']		= <<<BODY
<h3>How can I protect myself</h3>
<p>A large number of weapons of Defense scares some players already unfortunately, and are lured by others. As a result, you lose a lot of features, once defenses, nothing goes to the field of destruction, when they are destroyed. The only exception is the so-called destruction of defences, in which the attacker when te attacks, creates the destruction defenses on destruction (7% loss of defence not destruction account, account is the total loss of the defense in combat).</p>
<p>Additionally, there is the InterplanetÃ Missile, whose only aim is to destroy the defense. In contrast with the normal attack, the missiles are not again built. A well-planned attack, with several interplanetÃ missile reduces the danger at your own fleet considerably.</p>
<p>The increase in espionage research allows an increase to be able to see the contents of the other players. Thus, while this number is high, will s access to ships, defence, buildings or researches of the enemy</p>
<p>The best way of protection is no player see what you have in reality, during the time that does not have access to the Internet and they run a fleet. If the enemy attack, stole only the resources produced that was not taken by the fleet, which contributes to the enemy judging that is weak and thus avoids s probability he attack you</p>
<h3>OGame "Fleet Save"</h3>
<p>The Fleetsave of the fleet is a key component of OGame, but unfortunately a lot of players don't dominate the Fleetsave. So here's an explanation: there are many ways to its resources and its fleet of more or less secure to protect against the attacks of enemy fleets. Here are some of the almost 100% sure, but others are very uncertain.<br>The first method of Fleetsaves is "findand callback". This sends the player's fleet to a planet in your own area with the Mission of transfer. This video ´ will then stop after awhile. This is used for calculation in which the player makes Phalanx accounts related to the enemy fleet, with his time of combat. This method is not 100% sure, but if you don't you break on the final point, but a couple of hours before, just with a huge effort to intercept.<br>Note-many players "intelligent" doesn't manage to extract the Defender appear on, or returning to the fleet in flight!</p>
<p>A very common method of Fleetsave is sending a fleet and resources of a moon, and send to a destruction field services apart. This is not the account the amount of destruction, but if there is destruction. The naves are going and returning, with the destruction prices collected and with everything except</p>
<p>Another method of making fleet easily, is to make the Moon fleetsave Moon, in which enemies can't make phalanx the moons (Because these is that have the sensor!)</p>
BODY;

$LNG['questions'][2][3]['title']	= 'Moons';
$LNG['questions'][2][3]['body']		= <<<BODY
<p>A moon can occur when a field of destoÃ § os has at least some 100,000 units, which is then a 1% chance opportunity moon. High: is only 20% chance no matter how big is the moon.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The moons may have names like Planets but normally the default name is "Moon". You can have more than one moon, but a Moon by planet. The Satan © lites have the advantage that one of them invisible for the Fleetsave. On the Moon, you can build Warehouses, tank of DeutÃ © River, Fabrica de Robots or Nanites, Moonbase, Sensor Phalanx and the Portal Leap Quantico</p>
<h3>Sizes of moons</h3>
<p>The moon can be done depends on the number of Destruction € that are made.The greatest chance of creating a simple moon is hunting the 1667 in Light that creates a chance for 20% of the moon. Usas hunt the Cars because they are easy to be destroyed.</p><p>Otherwise, for which there is chance of moon, need to have defenses on the planet. It is recommended to build 3334 Lance missile or Light Lasers adores</p><p>The huge amounts that will be made of Destruction, will determine the training of moon around your planet</p><p>Probability Moon between 1% and 19% is of random size and probability of 20% the moon will have 8000 MILES in diameter<br>Regular moons are never exceeding 8944 km in diameter.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>The buildings can be Warehouses, tank of Deuterium, manufactures of Robots or Nanites, Hangar, deposit of Alliance, Moonbase, Sensor Phalanx and the Portal. The Hangar is useless to be built if the transfer to Planet Moon ships. The deposit of Alliance will be useful for defending the Moon attacks<br>The three specific buildings on the moon are:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Lunar Base</b><br>It is used to create new fields, in which are added 3 new fields for each level</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sensor Phalanx</b><br>It is used to see the activities of the fleet to the enemy planet, but this can not view of the moons. Has a limited range of galaxies, which are augmented by nivel</p></li>
<li><p><b>Jump Portal How romantic</b><br>This is used for transferring fleet of a moon for another instant, he simultaneously! But this is not the carries resources and time jumps between the fleet transfer isntantÃ ¢ nea is 1:0</p></li></ul>
<p>Here is a list of the ideal development of a Moon:<br>
<b>Legend:</b><br>
MB – Moon Base<br>
SP – Phalanx<br>
ST – Portal<br>
RB – Robots Factory</p>
<p>MB1 – RB1 – RB2 – MB2 – SP1 – RB3 – MB3 – SP2 – RB4 – MB4 – SP3 – RB5 – MB5 – SP4 – RB6 – MB6 – SP5 – SP6 – MB7 – SP7 – SP8 – MB8 – ST1<br>
This order is only suggested if you are newbie, because of course the more experienced players have their idea of development<p>
<h3>Destruction of Moon</h3>
<p>The moon can also be destroyed again, which is only allowed with specific ships.</p>
<p>In the Fleet menu, select the ships called "death star" or "Star Destroyer". When you arrive at the moment of choosing the mission to the Moon, choose "Destroy". These missions are not always successful, the moon will be destroyed and also cannot. In these battles there is the Destruction! The bigger the moon to be destroyed, more stars of death will be required and more risky is the attempted destruction of this!</p>
<h3>Size of the Moon:</h3>
<p>Destruction of 100000 units can render a 1% probability. The maximum probability is 20%.<p>
